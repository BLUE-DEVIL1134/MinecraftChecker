<h1 align="center" style="color: green;">Minecraft Checker</h1>

This is a simple project to check combos for `minecraft accounts` and save them to a file. Most importantly it's in a new growing language [`dart`](https://dart.dev/).
<br>
## Development
If you want to develop this project further we actively welcome contributions.
All you need to do it - 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BLUE-DEVIL1134/MinecraftChecker
cd MinecraftChecker
pub get
dart run
```
This will run the project. You can edit the script from [`lib/mian.dart`](https://github.com/BLUE-DEVIL1134/MinecraftChecker/blob/main/lib/main.dart).
<br>

## Executing Compiled Binaries
You can easily just install the binaries from the `github release` and move it to the folder containg the combos and run it.
